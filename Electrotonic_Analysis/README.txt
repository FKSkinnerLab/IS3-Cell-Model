Languague requirements:
NEURON (hoc)
Matlab

Summary:
This code performs shows an electrotonic analysis (see NEURON for using the GUI to generate these figures) and creates a dendrogram of the M1 and M2 morphologies of the IS3 cell model (Guet-McCreight et al, 2016).

Run Procedure:
1. Run either the "init_M1_Dendrogram.hoc" or "init_M2_Dendrogram.hoc" file in NEURON
2. One can also run "PlotDiamVsLength.m" in Matlab to try to generate a plot of diameter versus length, however this code is incomplete.
