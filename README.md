Summary:
This Github repository contains a variety of different folders, which run various types of simulations of the hippocampal interneuron specific 3 cell (IS3). For more details, see Guet-McCreight and colleagues (2016).

To explore particular simulations, check out the different folders, which should all contain README.txt files describing the work and how to run the simulations.

Because this Github repository was made "after-the-fact", a lot of the directories should be read over carefully and corrected where necessary in order to ensure that the code runs properly for any individual user. Also note that all the necessary add-on toolboxes should be found in the "AddedScriptsAndToolboxes" folder.

Please note that this repository will be in progress for as long as I am working on this project, which means that there is a lot of "raw" work in these folders, with some folders that are incomplete/put on hold.

With this in mind, if there are difficulties in running any of these simulations or if anything in unclear, I can be contacted at alexandre.guet.mccreight(at)mail.utoronto.ca.
