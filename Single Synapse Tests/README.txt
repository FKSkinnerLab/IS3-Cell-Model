Code by Alexandre Guet-McCreight
2015

Languague requirements:
NEURON (hoc)
Matlab

Summary:
This code estimates the threshold weight necessary for a single synapse to generate a spike at the soma of the variant IS3 cell models. To generate the plots seen in Guet-McCreight and colleagues (2016), go to the "NSG_SIMS_Saturation" subfolder.

Run Procedure:
1. Compile mod files (see NEURON Website for details on this: https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/)
2. Run "SingleSynapseTest.hoc" in NEURON.
3. Run "PlotResults.m" in Matlab.
