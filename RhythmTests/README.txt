Summary:
This code simulates additional rhythmically timed inputs (i.e. hippocampal theta or sharp wave-associated ripples - SWR) to the IS3 cell model representative in vivo-like scenarios. See the "HighCondReSampling" folder within the "HighCondRepresentativeModelTests" directory for more details on how these representative scenarios were chosen from the parameter space.

Make sure to update all directory paths as they were possibly changed during the development of this Github repository.

Run Procedure:
1. Compile mod files (see NEURON Website for details on this: https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/)
2. To run the analyses and plot the results, go to the particular directory and open the "init.py" file in python
