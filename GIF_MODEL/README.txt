Python

Summary:
This folder contains code and toolboxes written by other developpers (i.e. eFEL & GIFFittingToolbox - available at http://bluebrain.github.io/eFEL & https://wiki.epfl.ch/giftoolbox), which I was trying to use to reduce the IS3 multi-compartment model into a generalized integrate-and-fire model. I have not succeeded in my attempt to do this, and it will not likely be completed any time soon.
