Code by Alexandre Guet-McCreight
2017

Languague requirements:
NEURON (hoc)
Matlab

Summary:
This code simulates an experimental procedure for recording backpropagating action potential amplitudes. Plots are the same as in Guet-McCreight and colleagues (2016).

Note that for the SDprox1 and SDprox2 models, go to the SD50TopModels subfolder.

Run Procedure:
1. Compile mod files (see NEURON Website for details on this: https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/)
2. Run "SaveDendRecordings.hoc" in NEURON.
3. Run "GenerateSummaryFigures.m" in Matlab.
